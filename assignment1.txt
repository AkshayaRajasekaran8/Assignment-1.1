1.Various Sources of Big Data:
	a.Machine Log Data
	b.Media
	c.Sensor data
	d.Social media
	e.Business data

2.3 V's of Big Data:
a.Variety: Variety refers to number of types of data.		
b.Velocity: Velocity refers to speed of data processing.
c.Volume: Volume refers to the amount of data. It is acutally the size of data.

3.Horizontal scaling and Vertical scaling:
a. Horizontal  Scaling adding more machines into the pool of resources for
 the purpose of storing data.
b.Vertical scaling adding more power such as CPU cores, more storage RAM and 
more storage to improve query performance.

4. Need and Working of Hadoop:
Need:
Hadoop software is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large 
data sets across clusters of computer using simple programming models. It is used to 
scale up from single servers to thousands of machines which are having local storage 
and computation.It is the tool that actually gets data processed. 
Working:
It works by having  two nodes namely:
name node and data node.All the nodes are usually organized within the same physical 
rack in the data center. Data is the  broken down into separate blocks that are distributed
among the various data nodes for storage.Blocks are replicated to reduce failures.
